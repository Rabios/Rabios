# Hello, World!

Hello everyone!

My name's Rabia Alhaffar and pronounced in Arabic as "ربيع الحفار" while my nickname is "steria773", I'm from Syria (also I'm Muslim) and coding open-source stuff as hobby!

I got into programming at the age of 12 (started with C++) through Sololearn (Later left my account) then started to make open-source stuff in the beginning of 2018, While my stuff wasn't that good at that period but later with the blessings of Allah I got better since 2020

## Languages

I mostly make stuff with system programming languages such as C (and mostly [Nelua](https://nelua.io) at the meantime), But also like to fiddle with scripting languages like Lua and Ruby just for fun.

## Game Development

In the middle of 2019, I started making games with the well-known C game development library [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) and also contributed to the library by the bindings and libraries/tools done on my own till the near end of 2021 when switched to [DragonRuby GTK](https://dragonruby.org) and started to make a plenty of good games that you can see on [my itch.io account](https://rabios.itch.io)

Aside that, I engaged into the development of the HTML5 video games and this led to create [Pancake](https://github.com/Rabios/Pancake) as beloved framework to make web games.

Unfortunately, Nowdays I have lost the passion of making games due to the studies and my focus on writing libraries/tools which serves my work.

## Studies

Currently studying at Damascus University (Faculty of Information Technology Engineering) alongside making open-source stuff when the free time comes...
