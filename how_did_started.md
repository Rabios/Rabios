# How i started programming?

Back to 2016 when i wanted to know how websites and games made,

Then i found SoloLearn and was great as simple for me cause i'm beginner,

I started with C++,And it was the reason i quit programming for over 6 months,

Later,I found C# and learned it,Took me over a year to master it,And made C# REPL named "Sharpstone",

In the end of 2017 i decided to learn JavaScript and master it,And here is the beginning when i made a game engine called "Cake",

And by 2 years from 2018,I decided to learn how to use a lot of game engines and frameworks,

And i found [raylib](http://raylib.com) suddenly when i was searching for game engines and game frameworks to learn,

raylib is now my primary game framework,Along with Unity, LÃ–VE, And GDevelop,

That's all,Thanks for reading!
